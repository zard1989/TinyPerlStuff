This git repository stores some tiny programs in Perl.

Most of them have no practical functionalty.

Right now, here are three tiny scripts:

1. lcs.pl
   This program deals with the longest common subsequence problem, implemeting the algorithm I learnt from the algorithm class in NTU.

2. stamp.pl
   Try to solve the stamp problem, which is similiar to knapback problem.
   Again the algorithm is what I learnt from the algorithm class in NTU.

3. math.pl
   Currently, the script is functioned as a text calculator.
